# Movie Bucket List

## About

Movie Bucket List is a Rails app designed to help you keep track of all the movies you want to see. Users create Bucket Lists where they can store their must-see movies. If a User is unable to find the movie they want to see in the app, then they can easily create a new movie to add. Once a User has watched one of their movies, they can edit the bucket list and check off that movie as seen. 

## Installation & Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `rails s`.
