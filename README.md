# Movie Bucket List

## About

Movie Bucket List is a Rails app designed to help you keep track of all the movies you want to see. Users create Bucket Lists where they can store their must-see movies. If a User is unable to find the movie they want to see in the app, then they can easily create a new movie to add. Once a User has watched one of their movies, they can edit the bucket list and check off that movie as seen.

## Installation & Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `rails s`.

Then, register yourself as a user. You may sign up with the app or sign in using your Facebook account. Once you are registered, you will be taken to a page where you will see a list of all the movies you can add to your Bucket List. The first thing you should do is create a Bucket List by clicking `Create New Bucket List` at the top. Once that is created, you can go back to view all of the movies by clicking `All Movies` at the top. Now you can go through and click the `Add to Bucket List` button under the movies you want to add to your Bucket List. If you have multiple Bucket Lists, you are able to choose which Bucket List you would like the movie to be added to.
